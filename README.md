## About

This project is a sample project to quickly demonstrate
- a simple `sample-service` in `nodejs` 
- convert it into a docker image(containerization) using `Dockerfile`
- package the deployment using a helm chart using `helm/sample-service`
- deploy the service using helm chart onto local `kubernetes cluster` created with `kind`
- usage of `Makefile` (commands to facilitate all above items )
